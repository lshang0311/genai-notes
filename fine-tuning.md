# Fine-tuning

- [`OpenAI` documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning): 
```text
On July 6, 2023, we announced the deprecation of ada, babbage, curie and davinci models. These models, 
including fine-tuned versions, will be turned off on January 4, 2024. We are actively working on 
enabling fine-tuning for upgraded base GPT-3 models as well as GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4, we recommend 
waiting for those new options to be available rather than fine-tuning based off of the soon to be 
deprecated models.
```

Fine-tuning is possible with some of the models. See the section for case study.
